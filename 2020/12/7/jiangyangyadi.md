### Essential complexity

- As its adjective "essential", this kind of complexity is built in by the nature of the problem the software aims to solve

### Accidental complexity

- I would refer this kind of complexity as "introduced" complexity which is brought in by the solution of the problem rather than the problem itself

### What Accidental Complexity do to software

The author's main idea is roughly that: the reason why we always feel our progress is stagnated or behind schedule is we did not consider the accidental complexity but only the essential complexity when making the plan.

- Over the last 20 years, there has been the drastic reduction in the ratio of essential to accidental complexity => more accidental complexity has introduced
- Accidental complexity could come from the external frameworks and library, the embedded complexity in powerful tools, and etc. The following are some extra examples:
  - Source Control Tools
  - Automated Testing
  - Reconstructing & Splitting Up Legacies
  - Specialization & Cooperation
  - Infrastructure Automation
  - Frequent Deployments
  - Mutiple Devices & Form Compatible
- The more powerful the tool is, the rarer internal complexity you are exposed to, and then the higher complexity you will meet if something goes wrong
- Enormous demand of all kinds of software with customized features offset the huge amount of the gains from leveraging external tools and libraries
- Accidental complexity could also arise from the iteraction between overlapped systems, around all of the data movement and integrations
- Adopting new technology will definitely give you performance in some areas and look cool. However, this would import an unpredictable amount of accidental complexity for sure
  - It is kinda like a bomb that you would never know the time and the magnitude of its explosion until it truly happens
  - **Picking the most suitable tools, frameworks, or techniques to use is an incredibly valueble skill, for both individuals and the company**
