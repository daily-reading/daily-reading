# [Choose Boring Technology](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology)

* Embrace Boredom.
    * What counts as boring?
        * “Boring” should not be conflated with “bad.”
        * The nice thing about boringness (so constrained) is that the capabilities of these things are well understood. But more importantly, their failure modes are well understood.
    * When choosing technology, you have both known unknowns and unknown unknowns
        * 新的技术已知的未知和未知的未知都会比成熟的技术多得多
* 选择一门技术的时候需要考虑的是一个范围，整个团队，公司使用的技术都需要考虑
    * Adding technology to your company comes with a cost.   
    * 保持系统可靠工作的长期成本远远超过您在构建系统时遇到的困难
    * New tech eventually has company-wide effects, so adding tech is a decision that requires company-wide visibility.
        * 在经过大家讨论，并且制定过度方案，达成一致，可以引入新的技术　
    * 尝试能不能在不引入新的技术的前提下去解决问题，不要纯粹为了引入一门新的技术去引入新的技术
