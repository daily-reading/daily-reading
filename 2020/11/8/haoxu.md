scaling helps to avoid adding additional complexity, degraded perf, and reduced security.

Modularity
Notes:
1. micro service?
2. Q: how to design component boundaries?

Horizontal scaling
1. distribute load to multiple instances
2. need to support stateless scaling model
3. complemented with a modularity design.

Go serverless
Note: need to read the refernce.

Secure by design
