"The most visible change in moving to management is you get a lot less feedback"
Note: 我觉得还行吧，毕竟1on1会很多，direct reporting也会给很多的feedback.

Team building and teaching. 
Build trust on the team, execute on hiring (if they have headcount), and develop people on their team.
NOTE: 佷重要，manager的好坏和TEAM的氛围很大程度上决定了这个组的moral。当组员之间的关系不再是简简单单的同事，更像是生活中的朋友时，会make a difference.

Deliver results.
Ensure the team has a structure to execute on, get things done, and keep a high quality bar.
Note: 这个作为manager需要push，人是有惰性的。

Collaborate and connect. 
Keep an open communications channel with the team, connect people and teams, and run good meetings.
Vision. Ensure the team has a purpose and collect team values. Involve the team in planning for what the team will do.
Note: 1ON1, regular team meeting做planning和retrospective, 有自己的team channel，可以不仅仅聊工作上的，还有生活上的趣闻。

Professional growth. 
Keep growing as a person: set their own goals, work with a mentor, network with peers and give back.
Note: 好好利用1ON1的时间聊这方面的，MANAGER需要push

“My advice in using this checklist is this: don't blindly copy it: but customize it.”
NOTE：因地制宜，具体情况具体分析。

我觉得带小朋友时候最大的不同就是communication是以前做IC时候的很多倍，每天都会有不同地方的MESSAGE过来，自己亲自做HANDS ON的时间非常非常少，很多的时间是花在PLANNING和MANAGING上面
