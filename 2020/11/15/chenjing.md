I tell my team members that this is their time to get my undivided attention, and they should take advantage of it. The best conversations are the ones where someone comes prepared with an agenda, sometimes they even send it to me in advance.

在一对一会议开始前应当提前做好准备，可以提前准备一个提纲。

how can you ensure both you and your manager get the most of a one-on-one? First, make sure you have them on a recurring and ideally regularly scheduled basis.

如何保证一个有效的一对一会议？首先应当固定周期。


Ok, you’ve put in the work and your manager has made time for you on their calendar. How do you make the best use of it? 

固定周期后如何进行提前准备：

不要做基本的状态同步，考虑自己需要哪些帮助、建议、决策，需要你的manager了解哪些

提纲中应该考虑的主题：
1. Current projects 当前项目遇到的困难，是否需要manager做决策，是否需要其他成员或技能
2. Feedback 寻求反馈，最近几周做的好与不好之处，哪些可以做的更好？你在当下角色的最大优势？应当做哪些改进以取得进步？
3. Professional development 职业发展 尝试其他角色，想学习提高的技能，想参加的研讨会
4. Future opportunities 是否想参加某个项目，尝试进入领导职位，其他团队或角色感兴趣

Of course, thank them for their time, support, and advice at the end of each meeting. We all have a million ways to spend our time, and they choose to invest some of their time in you.

感谢对方能在忙碌之中参加与你的一对一会议，珍惜这些时间
