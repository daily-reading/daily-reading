#### *"Onboarding helps with employee retention rates, clarifies and sets expectations for the new hireâ€™s role, and lowers employee stress."*

Indeed, as a new grads, I extremelly appreciated the New Bull project that gave me a transitional phase to cusshion the huge impact from suddenly becoming a full-time engineer. I totally agree the above advantages of having a great onboarding process. It was not only about teaching us how to cooperate as professional engineers and what techniques we use in the company, but also letting us feel the common value we advocate and some well awared yet unwritten rules we need to follow. I was deadly anxious about my job which I knew would be dramatically different from my life as a student. Then, after 2 weeks of onboarding classes for warm-up, I was kinda familiar with this new enviornment and new colleagues, and gained a rough sketch about my future work domains through observation over the whole group as well. I felt much more comfortable about the rhythme of work and much more confident to learn to be a good engineer.

I remember GaoWei once told me that, "If you are not familiar with something, then you will be apt to think to be very complex and stun yourself." My exprience could be a perfect reflection of his words. Hence, onboarding is curcial for the new hires, especially for the new grads.

#### *"Provide documentation in onboarding handbooks and checklists"*

Somehow, we have not had organized and comprehensive documentation like handbooks or guidance to make clear all the necessary resources and work flows we may need. We do have some helpful documents that have explicit and operable steps, but these documents are scattered and hidden in tens of other documents with similar titles yet completely unwanted content. It is hard for a new hire to know which post is official and most helpful, and sometimes there are post delievery misleading or outdated messages. Just as said in the article, *"Onboarding resources are less helpful if the new hire has to search for them on their own"*



#### Things that might help

- Ensured continuous updates to our engineering handbooks. It would be a plus if the quick-start handbooks are provides from the credible official source instead of an arbitrary person.
- Encourage new hires to update any outdated or incorrect information in documentation.
- Design a in-depth survey to start a positive feedback loop
