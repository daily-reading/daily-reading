# Mastery in Software Engineering

Mastery in Software engineering cover a very broad spectrum. The author tries to summarize them in the following categories.

## Tool/Technical Proficiency
1. Abilities to develop tool/library for other developers.
2. Breadth vs depth in different tools
3. However, any particular tools will outdated some day. (e.g. Adobe Flash or COBOL)
4. Today's tech stach seems more transferrable

## Ability to assess the trade-offs
"Expert engineers are able to avoid work that does not provide valuve and this could be their greatest skill."

1. Making trades-off correctly requires knowledge in multiple approaches. 
2. trade-off between accuracy vs complexity, speed vs precision, performance vds extensibility.
3. Master interfacing with the rest of the organisation would help you make trade-off decisions.
4. Ability to think about a problem in a broader context.

## Focus on shipping value
1. High ratio of value shipped to hours worked. Or Value-add in unit-hours. (Which obviously makes sense)
2. It would require push back against non-valuable work.

## Managing complexity 
1. Find out he irreducible complexities, and put the complexity where you want it. 
2. Helping others to understand the code faster by identifying and removing most of the accidental complexity. (No better feeling than removing redundant code!)
3. A master would be able to build systems such that the cost of adding more value to the system remains constant as the system grows in complexity.

## Ability to keep learning
1. Find as many solutions to given problem as you can
2.
