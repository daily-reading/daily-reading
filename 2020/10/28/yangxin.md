# When is no-code useful?
## what is no-code
```
A no code development platform is a tool for building software applications without coding;
a popular and promising alternative to traditional software development for non-technical business users hoping to build their own full-fledged applications.
```
## yes code software
- 能够演进适应变化
···
how to build and evolve software systems against changing requirements and constraints that span years and decades.
···
- engineer的指责就是知道如何根据需求演进系统
···
how to change software systems. Change is the name of the game.
···
- buil tools to make it easier to change code and remain stable
- operate large software teams
- 抽象：封装出独立(isolate)的部分，从而在不影响 code base 中其他部分的情况下进行变更

## no-code
- 不适合大型开发项目
···
Traditional software has learned the abstractions and patterns that make software resilient and adaptable to change and scale. 
No-code software is not ready for changing constraints nor development scale.
···

## When is no-code useful
- 暂时的，有限生命周期的项目
···
 by giving up some of the adaptability of software abstractions of code, 
 no-code software benefits from way faster prototyping speed.
···
- 代码频繁变化，但是不需要演进

## Avoiding the same mistakes
- no code并不是让engineer写更少的代码，code更简单
- no code关注的焦点不是在变化中保证软件的课伸缩性
- 写代码不是寻求解决方案，而是演进他们
- nocode应该叫reifying workflows
- 是为了减少重复工作，并加快工作效率
···
no-code 工具是流程、工作流工具的扩展
···

···
complexity needs to go somewhere
···
