# Things I Learnt from a Senior Software Engineer
作者刚在bloomberg工作一年，从senior里学到了很多，决定每年记录下来
- Further, in my team culture it’s not frowned upon to “snoop behind” people writing code.  感觉这点还是挺难得的，很多人会觉得不舒服
- 有兴趣就可以随时凑上去看
## Writing code
### How to name stuff
- Meaningful naming
- dont creat god class
- 不太认同命名为x，y，z
### Legacy code and the next developer
- 文档以及代码注释的重要性
- 如何让自己的代码易读
> “The main value in software is not the code produced, but the knowledge accumulated by the people who produced it.” - Li
### Atomic commits
- 一次commit干一件事
### Becoming confident about deleting shit code
- Delete code you’ll never reach, and be cautious with code you don’t understand.
### Code Reviews
- Don’t approve code till I understand how it works.
## Design
### Designing with maintenance in mind
- First part is not deprecating old stuff, always adding more
- The second part is designing with an end goal in mind.
## When things go wrong
> For when things go wrong, and they will, the golden rule is minimizing client impact.
- fisrt, roll back
- 再去fix bug
- 找bug深度优先搜索效率太低，宽度优先搜索
- 先查找环境问题
- line by line检查代码是最后的排查方法
- 总结排查bug一个小时以上的经历


# Things I Learned to Become a Senior Software Engineer
## Learning what people around me are doing
> Since we’re not in a closed system, it makes sense to better understand the job of the product managers, the sales people, and the analysts. 
- 自己的工作只是其中一环，能还原出全貌更能明白自己在做些什么
## Learning good habits of mind
- 发生Y就能立马想到X
### Strategies for making day-to-day more effective
