A Checklist For First-Time Engineering Managers

* Team building and teaching. Build trust on the team, execute on hiring (if they have headcount), and develop people on their team.
* Deliver results. Ensure the team has a structure to execute on, get things done, and keep a high quality bar.
* Collaborate and connect. Keep an open communications channel with the team, connect people and teams, and run good meetings.
* Vision. Ensure the team has a purpose and collect team values. Involve the team in planning for what the team will do.
* Professional growth. Keep growing as a person: set their own goals, work with a mentor, network with peers and give back.
