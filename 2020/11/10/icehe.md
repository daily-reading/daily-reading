## Digests

Most people don't practice taking ideas seriously. I think it's because most people don't know how to _( …大多数人并不知道 "怎么做" )_ . I didn't either, until I stumbled upon an implication _( …直到偶然发现 )_ .

For example, what would it mean to take compounding _( 复利 )_ seriously?

Ugh. I can feel your aversion _( 厌恶 )_ . You've already heard so much about compounding, how it works, how it's the eight wonder of the world _( 世界第八大奇迹 )_ , etc. etc.

But, familiarity _( 熟悉 )_ is not the same as taking it seriously _( 认真对待这件事 )_ .

Say you start with $100, and every year, make 10% more. This compounds, since the extra money is a function of how much you already have. The more you have, the more you get. It's a positive loop that keeps on increasing.

That's the familiar interpretation. The earlier you start, the more money you'll make.

To take this interpretation seriously would mean investing your earnings for a similar return. [Reality has a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail), and sometimes assumptions break. You don't make 10% - which means you need to balance your investments somehow. That makes things complicated. However, this complication is not related to compounding.

Taking compounding seriously means taking it a step further. Your net worth _( 净值 )_ is just one implication _( 含义 )_ . **What else compounds?**

**Your life experiences and knowledge.** What would it mean to leverage compounding here?

If you're taking compounding seriously, you'd **learn the skills with the greatest return first**. That means learning the broadest applicable _( 最广泛使用的 )_ skills you'd apply throughout your life first. That means **learning <u>how to think well</u> - before learning the new fancy tech you want to learn.**

Of course, sometimes you need a medium to learn the skill better. That makes sense: learn to think well via this new tech you wanted to learn. [Purposes are fragile](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/3HyeNiEpvbQQaqeoH) though, and **it's easy to get lost in the tool, instead of the overall goal.**

What makes this example so good is that you're probably very familiar with compounding. What else are you familiar with, but haven't realised you're not taking seriously?

A good way to practice this is to ask this question: What are the implications of (idea) in (field of interest)?

For example, asking myself What are the implications of compounding for my self-directed knowledge base led to the above insight of learning broader skills first.
